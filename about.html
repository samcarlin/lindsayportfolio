            Foster mom to dozens of dogs and cats over the past six years
            I’ve wanted to anchor since at least the sixth grade
            ​

            Ever since I can remember...

            I've always wanted to be a journalist. My fascination with TV news began as a kid when I would go to work
            with my mom. She was an engineer for 36 years at Fox 8 in Cleveland, OH.

            ​

            My journalism career has taken me to five different local stations and two networks. Throughout, I've done
            almost every job in the business, from a network-level producer putting together segments for
            then-businessman Donald Trump, to working as a one-man-band bureau chief out of my apartment, and even
            becoming a main evening anchor.

            ​

            At Spectrum, I provided network live shots for Spectrum stations across the country for the Detroit
            Democratic Debate. I then turned around to anchor for 10 hours during the Dayton, OH mass shooting in 2019.

            ​

            My coronavirus reports were the first of local coverage in Ohio to feature an Ohioan trapped in Wuhan, China
            when the pandemic first began. When Ohio got its first case, I was the anchor breaking into coverage.

            ​

            I am not only passionate about telling stories to open people's eyes and hearts, my goal is to find a way to
            personally make a difference in every community I live in. At Spectrum, I created a station partnership with
            Speak for the Unspoken, a statewide rescue that focuses on taking in animals with special needs. Those
            features have led to countless adoptions and tens of thousands of dollars raised to help pay for care and
            surgeries for animals that would otherwise be put down due to cost.



            Fostering dogs and cats over the last six years is a big part of my personal life. I foster for Speak and
            created a calendar fundraiser in 2020 raising $10,000 for the organization. Caring for animals in need has
            been one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
